# Cryptography

Package for cryptographic algorithms

[Cryptography Documentation](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)

## Implementation in Certificate API

This implementation includes:

- RSA Private Key generation
- PEM encoding
- SHA-256 Hashing

## More about X.509

A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) standard that is commonly used for TLS.

Assymetic Keys: Encryption and decryption uses different keys.

- Public Key: Visible in the browser. Encrypt message sent to server/service that can be decrypted by private key. Can verify signatures from private key.
- Private Key: Hidden from the browser. Used by server side to decrypt message received from public key and to encrypt signatures which can be verified by public key.
- Keys are in pairs or 1:1 relationship.

### Private Key

Private key can be generated by various algorithms including RSA, ECDSA, and DSA.

- RSA is commonly used. Larger key sizes provide increased security but require more computation and impact performance speed.
- ECDSA is faster than DSA and RSA. Same level of security can be provided for shorter key lengths and requires less memory.
- DSA is faster in descryption than RSA.

### Hashing Algorithm

During certificate signing process, hashing algorithm is used to create a hash of the certificate data which is then signed by the private key.

- SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
